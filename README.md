# EU Regulated Parking Profile
## Context
In support of the EU ITS directive (2010/40/EU), Delegated Regulations have been established and
adopted to support the deployment of more coherent ITS information services covering a range of topics including multimodal travel information, traffic management, traffic information, safe and secure truck parking, etc. These Delegated Regulations place obligations upon EU Member States to enact national legislation that will make a range of transport and mobility data available, including references to parking data, park and ride information, etc.

This paper examines the relevant Delegated Regulations and draws out which requirements reasonably apply to parking data. It also discusses the geographic extent of the Regulations and their implementation timeframes.

The requirements are summarised, and simplified, and presented in the Summary that is presented in Section 0.

Section 0 provides links to each of the published and adopted Delegated Regulations.

Section 0 details parking related data requirements in each of the listed Delegated Regulations. Section 0 provides a brief insight on what EPA should do next.

## Why is this important to the European parking sector?
The European Union Delegated Regulations have been adopted by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers and cascade to become national law in each of the European Union Member States. How each Member State goes about achieving the requirements of the Delegated Regulations may be different. In general, a lead national ministry (most likely the ministry of transport) will take steps to ensure the data required by the Delegated Regulations is made available.

Why does this affect the European parking sector? Because parking providers, parking service suppliers or parking data integrators are potentially the actual source of the required parking-related data and will thus have to comply directly with the described Delegated Regulations below.
